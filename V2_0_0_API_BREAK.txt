This file contains the list of potential API break. A pattern was used to look through all your files and note the spots where you might have a problem. Not everything here is broken./ns\.scp/g
scp arguments were switch, it is now scp(files, destination, optionally_source). If you were using 2 argument (not 3) this doesn't affect you.

	sendto.js
		Line 3 if (!await ns.scp(ns.args[0], ns.args[1])) {
	sendtoall.js
		Line 7 if (!await ns.scp(ns.args[0], list[i])) {


/ns\.stock\.buy/g
buy is a very common word so in order to avoid ram costs it was renamed ns.stock.buyStock

	buystock.js
		Line 12 ns.stock.buy(ns.stock.getSymbols()[i], 1);


/hacking/g
The work system is completely reworked and ns.getPlayer().hacking no longer exists. This data is likely available inside ns.getPlayer().currentWork, skills, exp, or hp

	buystock.js
		Line 3 //hacking a server can lower stock value
